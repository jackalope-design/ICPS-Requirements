# ICPS Requirements

Made for the class: **CSC 436 - Requirements Engineering**

This is a full Requirements specification for an autonomous car / intersection control system (ICPS). Me and my groupmates worked on: IEEE structure, Context Entities, Solution Oriented Requirements (Goals, Responses, Scenarios, Constraints), Functional Hazard Analysis, Failure Mode and Effects Analysis, KAOS Diagram, Sequence Diagrams, Activity Diagram, State Diagram, Class Diagram, and a GSN Safety case Diagram.
